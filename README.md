# TreadBot-Minor-Project
A gesture detection system that is used to drive a treaded Tank.

How it works:

TreadBot - a hand-gesture driven robotic vehicle, was our team’s third year project. 
The gesture recognition is based on Haar’s filters trained by thousands of positive and negative samples, which our team had 
collected: videographics of hundreds of hand-samples later processed into sample positive inputs for the filter.

The image is taken as an input from the camera attached to a Raspberry Pi placed on the TreadBot.

The users hand gestures, which acts as a feed to the fitler, then guides the robot.
